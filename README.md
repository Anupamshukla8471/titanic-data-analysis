# Titanic Survival Prediction ðŸš¢

This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset using machine learning to predict whether a passenger survived or not. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation using multiple classification algorithms.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

This dataset is from the [Kaggle Titanic Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). It contains information about passengers such as:

- Name
- Age
- Gender
- Class
- Siblings/Spouses aboard
- Parents/Children aboard
- Fare
- Embarked location
- Survival (target)

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Understand the structure of the Titanic dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Clean and preprocess the data
- Train multiple machine learning models
- Evaluate and compare model performances
